# Project: Investigate a Dataset 
For this project, I decided to analyse the TMDb movie data set provide by Kaggle. This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue. I analyze a dataset and communicated my findings about it. I used the Python to explore TMDb movie data. But what determines if a movie is considered as good or bad? There could be several factors influencig the quality of a movie, as for example the budget, genre, etc. This little project helped the author to improve his data analytics skills and explore some of the success criteria for movies.

# Questions to answer
For this data set, I will answer some interesting questions :
- What is the best runtime for a movie ?
- Which genre has the most movies ?
- Which genres are most popular?
- Which genre has the longest average runtime ?
- Which genre has the longest average vote count ?
- Which genre has highest average budget ?
- Which genre has highest average revenue ?
- Which genre has highest average profit ?
- Which release year has the highest revenue and budget ?
- Which release year has the highest average Profit?
- Which release year has the highest average Popularity ?
- Which release year has the highest average vote count ?
- What kinds of properties are associated with movies that have high revenues?
- Which genres are most popular from year to year?

# Data Wrangling

First some Data Wrangling was applied, before the data was cleaned in order to perform Exploratory Data Analysis
